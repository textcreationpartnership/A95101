            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Friend of mine acquainting me, That Mr. <hi>Locker</hi> at the time of his Death had taxed the Lord Generals Court Martial with Tyrannical and Unjuſt Proceedings againſt him, pretending he was unjuſtly condemned, with many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to that purpoſe, ſo as divers godly men there preſent, who knew nothing of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, more then what fell from his mouth, were much grieved and offended at his death, and proceedings of the Court; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112021:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 67 -->that I was preſent with the Court at his Tryal, and able to give an Account of the whole Proceedings, deſired me for publique Satisfaction, to publiſh a Narrative there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: which is as followeth;</p>
            <p>UPon the 24 of this inſtant <hi>April,</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain <hi>Savage</hi> having received Orders to march with his Troop to the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz of the Regiment at <hi>Mile-end-Green,</hi> commanded his Trumpet to ſound to Horſe; which accordingly was done: But about thirty of the Troop, of whom <hi>Robert Locker</hi> was chief, about two of the clock in the Afternoon went to the Four Swans Inn in Biſhopſgate ſtreet, there ſeized upon the Colours, and carried them to the Bull Inn in the ſame ſtreet, where they forcibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them: Whereupon their Captain went to them, demanding the Reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and withal commanded them to bring out the Colours and mount: but they deny both telling him, They were not his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours carriers, That they had, as well as he, fought for them. In this maner they kept
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:112021:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 67 -->the Colours all that day, and the next night, refuſing (although often perſwaded and commanded by their Captain) to obey the ſaid Orders.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That evening the Regiment by Order returned to their former quarters, and their Officers knowing that the day following they were to march into the countrey to quarter, lent them for their better accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation out of their own purſes (having newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome moneys) a Fortnights pay; but withal Ordered, That Captain</hi> Savage <hi>his Troop ſhould have onely their pay due to them, and no more, by reaſon of their diſobedience to Commands, that Troop being alſo at that time one moneths pay before the Regiment, excepting Captain</hi> Cannons <hi>Troop, which was equal with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Account ſtanding thus, The 19 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> laſt they came to <hi>London,</hi> and to the 20 of <hi>Apr</hi> following, makes nineteen weeks, and upon the 23 of <hi>April</hi> (upon which day they afterwards Mutinyed) they received one Moneths pay; which pay made them twenty three weeks, which to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain

               <!-- PDF PAGE 68 -->
               <hi>Cannons</hi> Troop, and Captain <hi>Savage</hi>'s Troop, was to each of them one Moneths pay more then the reſt of the Regiment had: (Good husbands needed not to have wanted money to pay their quarters, after ſuch Receipts.)</p>
            <p>The next morning Orders were given out by the Col: for a Rendezvouz of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again at <hi>Mile-end-Green,</hi> in order to their March to Quarter in the Countrey; in obedience whereunto their Captain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſound to Horſe, which was done: but moſt of Captain <hi>Savage</hi> his Soldiers, in ſtead of mounting, put themſelves in a poſture of defence in the Galleries of the Bull-Inn, with their Swords and Piſtols, ſtanding upon their Guard; their Captain hearing thereof, went to them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to mount: But they anſwered, The Soldiers of the other Troops had a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights pay more then they, which they ſaid they would have before they march'd. Their Captain perceiving they had caſt off all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Commands, went into the room
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:112021:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 68 -->where they had ſecured the Colours, and there lays hold of them to bring them away, but they force them out of his hands; <hi>Locker</hi> telling him, The Colours belonged aſwel to them as to him, and that they had aſwel fought for them as he; to which they cryed, <hi>All, All.</hi> The Captain thereupon made his application to the Colonel; the Colonel ſent the captain with his Quarter-maſter back to them, ſtrictly commanding them, as from him, to march to the Rendezvouz, where, if they had any juſt complaints, he would hear them, and ſee them righted: But they not ſatisfied therewith, returned a peremptory refuſal: The Colonel thereupon, with his Major and others of his Officers, rid to them, where he found Sixty of them in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Poſture of Defence, ſtanding upon their Guard; he commands them to Mount, they pretend they had not a fortnights pay, as others of the Regiment: The Colonel tells them, They could not extort Moneys from their Officers, where it was not due, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that fortnights pay to be lent them, in regard of their Diſobedience and Mutiny,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 69 -->they being likewiſe now in pay a fortnight before the reſt of the Regiment ſince they came to <hi>London,</hi> except one Troop as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; They then replyed, They were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde of their pay: Upon Examination whereof, it appeared to be but Three or Four days; But in regard ſome of them ſaid it was Five days, the Colonel commanded the Clerk to give them Five days pay, they then pretended want of Money to pay their Quarters; the colonel thereupon ingaged, They ſhould not want for diſcharge of their Quarters; and being thus ſatisfied to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Demands and Objections, they then required of the Col: that he ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to pay them their arrears, the Col: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceiving they had a further deſign, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated ſo much to them, and poſitively again commanded them to come down &amp; mount, but ſtill they refuſed: The Colonel upon this ſpake to ſeveral of them, and <hi>Locker</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be one of the chief, called particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to him to come down and mount; but he refuſed, turning himſelf to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſeemingly asked their conſents, to which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112021:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 69 -->they cryed, <hi>No, No.</hi> In this maner they mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinied againſt their colonel, and the yard and ſreet being full of People, they endeavored to incenſe them, telling them, They wanted their Pay; the colonel perceiving neither perſwaſions nor commands would take place, and foreſeeing by the gathering of much people together, there was like to be an uproar, and having two Troops of Horſe with him, required the people to go out of the yard, and commanded them to yield themſelves, as they would anſwer for all the blood that ſhould be ſpilt, for he would not be longer capitulated with, but would force their obedience; upon this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them got away, and fifteen of them were taken into cuſtody, the General and Leiutenant General, upon notice thereof, coming at that very inſtant to ſuppreſs the ſaid mutiny.</p>
            <p>Upon the 26 of this inſtant April, a Court Martial was called, conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Officers both of Horſe and Foot, and after every of them ſo taken into cuſtody, had particularly anſwered to his charge, and

            <p>The Lieutenant General, upon ſight of this their Petition, and their ſeeming unfeigned Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Contrition, being much affected therewith, became an earneſt Suiter to the General for their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, which he obtained; and the other Five ſentenced to ride the wooden Horſe, the General referred to the Colonel to remit their puniſhment, if he ſaw cauſe.</p>
            <p>But his Excellency not pardoning <hi>Locker,</hi> the Court Martial iſſued forth a Warrant for his Execution.</p>
            <p>And although the ſaid <hi>Locker</hi> ſeemed very peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent before the Generals Anſwer was returned, and expreſſed much remorſe for his offence; yet ſo ſoon as the Generals reſolution was known, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately fell into as high expreſſions of Mutiny as at the firſt: And Mr. <hi>Knight</hi> the Generals Chaplain offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Spiritual counſel unto him, was rejected with moſt opprobrious and ſcornful language.</p>
            <p>And in this diſtemper and pride of Spirit, going to the place of execution, in ſtead of being humbled from a due ſence of his condition, he railed at the Sentence of the Councel, calling the Court Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical; falſly denying that he had at all confeſſed before the Court Martial, himſelf to be chief in the mutiny; upon which Col: <hi>Okey</hi> wiſhed him to take heed of dying with a lye in his mouth: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſaid <hi>Locker</hi> proceeded on ſtill in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, calling to the Soldiers appointed for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, ſaying, I ſee you are drawn out to murther me, God forgive you, I do freely; I wonder you are ſo unwiſe to obey your Officers, for he that ſheds mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſpilt,

               <!-- PDF PAGE 72 -->and in this mutinous ſpirit he continued to the laſt. And now I have given a true Narrative of the whole buſineſs as requeſted, by which the impartial Reader may ſee, with what lenity the Court Martial hath proceeded, and what mercy the General hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſuch high Mutiniers, and had it not been timouſly ſuppreſt, the City had been in no ſmall danger of ruine in theſe diſcontented times; but let <hi>God</hi> have the praiſe, as well for preventing Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as for delivering us out of them; and as for Mr. <hi>Locker,</hi> I leave him to the Lord, before whom he ſtands or falls to eternity, but this will be ſaid of him, That as he lived, ſo he dyed, <hi>A Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinier.</hi>
